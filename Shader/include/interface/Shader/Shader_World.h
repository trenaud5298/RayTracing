 * @file Shader_World.h
 * @brief Namespace For Managing The Scene Rendered By The Shader Library.
 *
 * ================================================================================  
 * World Management Overview  
 * ================================================================================  
 * The `Shader::World` Namespace Provides Methods To Define And Modify The Scene That  
 * The Ray Tracing Algorithm Renders, Including:  
 *  
 *  - Adding, Removing, And Modifying Objects.  
 * 
 *  - Configuring Lights, Cameras, And Materials.  
 * 
 *  - Querying Scene Information.  
 *  
 * ================================================================================  
 * Scene Editing Workflow  
 * ================================================================================  
 *  - Use `Shader::World` Methods To Dynamically Modify The Scene Without Restarting The Shader.  
 * 
 *  - Changes To The Scene Will Reflect Immediately During The Next Render Cycle.  
 *  
 * ================================================================================  
 * Important Notes  
 * ================================================================================  
 *  - Ensure That Scene Changes Are Compatible With Current Shader Settings To Avoid Conflicts.  
 * 
 *  - Complex Scenes May Require Additional Computation Time, Depending On GPU Capabilities.  
 *  
 * ================================================================================  
 * @see Shader_Settings.h For Configuring Scene-Related Settings.

     * This Method Handles The Initialization Of The Shader's Rendered World.
     * 
     * This Method Is Called Automatically From `Shader::init()` To Set Up The 
     * Default Scene That The Shader Will Render. It Prepares All Necessary Data 
     * Structures And GPU Resources Required To Store And Manipulate Objects, Lights, 
     * And Other Scene Elements.
     * 
     * Users Can Modify The Scene After Initialization Using The Methods Provided 
     * In `Shader::World`. If Any Errors Occur During Initialization, Refer To The 
     * Logging System For Debugging Information.
     * 
     * @return True, If The World Is Successfully Initialized.
     * @return False, If World Initialization Fails. See Error Logs For More Details.
